# EasyClass

This is my project Online classroom using Django framework. 
The main apps inside this project are: 
- Students : All information about students and a form which students can use to submit or update their personal information. 
- Classses: All details of each classes and also a form where students can submit their homework, examas, assignments. 
- Schoolcalendar: visual calendar where students or teachers can add new event. This app was created using CSS so it is easier for users to use. 
- Notifications: this is where the teachers can post importtant notice or urgent messages to students. 
- Experiment: I want to add this part into my project as initially I want to do a project for children classroom. This is where the students can find some fun activities to do at home. 
Besides all the applications that I have created, I add AllAuth to my project. Users can get access to EasyClass using their Github login.
